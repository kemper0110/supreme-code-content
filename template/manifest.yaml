  # Your first problem! 
  
  Given an array of integers `nums`Â and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.
 
  You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.
 
  You can return the answer in any order.
 
  **Example 1:**
 
  **Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
  **Output:** \[0,1\]
  **Explanation:** Because nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] == 9, we return \[0, 1\].
