name: Multiples of 3 or 5
description: |
  If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

  Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 **below** the number passed in.

  Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.

  **Note:** If the number is a multiple of **both** 3 and 5, only count it _once_.
